In the simple Salesforce API trailhead, we created an API without any real definition. It does not handle a simple scenario such as HTTP 404, it does not give a predefined JSON response for success or error. 
Consider a production level API where you are receiving error for just misspelling a resource's name and you can not identify the reason because API doesn't handle 404. These situations can be gracefully handled and should be handled in any production ready API. It will make life easier for every consumer if we decide on a structure of a request and response for our API.
