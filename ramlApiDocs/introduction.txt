In the simple Salesforce API trailhead, we created an API without any real definition. It does not handle the simple scenario such as HTTP 404. API does not give predefined JSON response. 
Consider a production level API where you are receiving error in invalid format for just misspelling a resource's name. These situations can be gracefully handled and should be handled in any production ready API. It will make life easier for every developer if we decide on a structure of a JSON/XML request and response for our API.
